# Cache Busting Implementation

This document explains the changes implemented to prevent the white screen issue that users were experiencing after application updates until they manually cleared their browser cache.

## Problem

When pushing updates to the application with `git push`, users were seeing a white screen until they cleared their browser cache. This occurred because:

1. The browser cached JavaScript, CSS, and other assets
2. After a deployment, the server had new code but users' browsers were still loading old cached files
3. This version mismatch between the HTML and cached assets caused the application to break, resulting in a white screen

## Solution Overview

The solution implements a comprehensive cache busting strategy through three complementary approaches:

1. **Content Hashing in Build Process**: Ensures each unique file version has a unique filename
2. **Cache Control Headers**: Proper HTTP caching directives for both cached and non-cached resources
3. **Client-Side Cache Management**: JavaScript utility to detect version changes and clear caches

## Implementation Details

### 1. Vite Build Configuration (`vite.config.js`)

Added content hashing to all asset filenames to force cache invalidation:

```javascript
build: {
  // ... existing config ...
  
  // Enable content hashing in filenames for cache busting
  assetsDir: 'assets',
  sourcemap: true,
  manifest: true,
  // Use content hashing to force cache invalidation when files change
  chunkFileNames: 'assets/js/[name]-[hash].js',
  entryFileNames: 'assets/js/[name]-[hash].js',
  assetFileNames: 'assets/[ext]/[name]-[hash].[ext]'
}
```

This ensures that whenever a file changes, its filename also changes, forcing browsers to download the new version instead of using the cached one.

### 2. Cache Control Headers

#### HTML Meta Tags (`index.html`)

Added cache control meta tags to the main HTML file:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" />
<meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache" />
<meta http-equiv="Expires" content="0" />
```

These tags instruct browsers not to cache the main HTML file, ensuring users always get the latest version with references to the current asset files.

#### Server Configuration (`.htaccess` in CI/CD Pipeline)

Modified the GitHub Actions workflow to create an `.htaccess` file with proper cache headers:

```
# No caching for index.html and other non-hashed files
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0

# Long-term caching for hashed assets (1 year)
<FilesMatch "\.([0-9a-f]{8,})\.((js|css|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp|svg|woff2))$">
  Header set Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
</FilesMatch>
```

### 3. Client-Side Cache Manager (`cacheManager.js`)

Created a utility to handle cache invalidation on the client side:

```javascript
// Key features:
// - Stores a version identifier in localStorage
// - Compares stored version with current version on app load
// - Clears browser caches and service workers when version changes
// - Provides methods for forced reload if needed
```

This utility serves as an additional layer of protection, ensuring that any cached resources are cleared when the application is updated.

## How It Works Together

1. When you build and deploy a new version:
   - Content hashing generates new filenames for changed assets
   - CI/CD pipeline deploys the files and sets up proper cache headers

2. When a user visits the app after an update:
   - The browser downloads the HTML file (not cached due to cache-control headers)
   - The HTML references the new hashed asset files
   - The client-side cache manager detects any version change and clears caches

## Benefits

- **No More White Screens**: Users will always get a functioning application
- **Optimal Performance**: Long-term caching for assets that rarely change
- **No Manual Cache Clearing**: The system handles cache invalidation automatically
- **Graceful Updates**: Version transitions happen smoothly without user intervention

## Testing

To test these changes:
1. Deploy a new version of the application
2. Visit the application in a browser without clearing cache
3. The application should load correctly without showing a white screen
4. Check the browser's network tab to verify that:
   - The main HTML file is freshly loaded (not from cache)
   - Hashed assets are either loaded from cache or downloaded as needed
