PLACEHOLDER IMAGE NEEDED

To complete the marketplace functionality:

1. Add a placeholder image file named "tileset-placeholder.png" in this directory
2. The image should be a simple grid pattern representing a tileset
3. Recommended size: 256x256 pixels
4. The file should be a PNG image

When a tileset image fails to load, the application will try to use this placeholder image instead.
