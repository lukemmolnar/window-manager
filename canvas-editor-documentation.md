The Canvas Editor is an Obsidian-style node-based editor that allows you to create, edit, and connect text nodes with arrows. This editor is integrated into the file explorer for `.canvas` files.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new `.canvas` file in the file explorer or open an existing one
2. The Canvas Editor will automatically open when you select a `.canvas` file
3. You'll see a blank canvas or the previously saved content

There are two ways to create new text nodes:

1. **Using the toolbar**:
   - Click the "Add Node" button in the toolbar
   - Enter your text in the popup dialog
   - Click "Create" to add the node to the canvas

2. **Using drag and drop**:
   - Find the "Drag to create" panel in the top-left corner
   - Drag the "Text Node" item onto the canvas
   - Drop it where you want the node to appear

### Editing Nodes

- **Double-click** on any node to edit its content

2. You'll see connection points appear on the node
3. Click and drag from one of these points to another node
